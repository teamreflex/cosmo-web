## Issues

- User searchbox has blurred text
- Collections search/dropdown has keyboard controls which makes the searchbox a little jank
- `<FilteredObjektDisplay>` should be virtualized
- Grid slot selector doesn't have locked tokens filter
- ActionOverlay is jank and should be refactored

### General

- Move project to a monorepo, move indexer into here

### Gravity

- Implement combination poll voting

### Trades / PolygonScan replacement

- Add filtering
- Add transfer hash
