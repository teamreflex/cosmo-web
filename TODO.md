### Auth

- Test Cosmo token refreshing.

### Grid

- Look into grid submission recovery
  - eg: `/complete` succeeds but `/claim-reward` fails. Reward claiming needs to be resumable.

### Gravity

- Implement voting
- Implement combination poll display
- Clean up poll result display for multi-poll gravities

### Collection

- Look into marking objekts as "up for trade" or go all-in on a WTT system
  - would probably require indexing all possible objekts
- Wishlist creator tool?

### General

- Replace Cosmo logo with something more generic
