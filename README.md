# cosmo-web (Apollo)

This project aims to build a web based version of [MODHAUS](https://www.mod-haus.com/)' **[Cosmo: the Gate](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.modhaus.cosmo)** mobile application, replicate its core features as close as possible, and add new features on top.

**Apollo is not affiliated with, endorsed by or supported by MODHAUS or its artists.**

## Note

On April 18th 2025, MODHAUS migrated COSMO over to a new blockchain and to a new authentication provider, with encryption that prevents tampering with the sign-in process. This `refactor/abstract` branch is a stripped down version of the platform with almost all COSMO features removed and migrated over to using the Abstract blockchain.

The [`main`](https://github.com/teamreflex/cosmo-web/blob/main) branch remains as the final Polygon-compatible version before the migration occurred. It will not work with the current version of the COSMO API.

## Features
